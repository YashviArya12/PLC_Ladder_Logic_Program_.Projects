# PLC Ladder Logic Program Projects

## Overview
This repository is a curated collection of **PLC ladder logic projects** developed using Siemens and Mitsubishi platforms. Each project demonstrates a specific industrial automation workflow, complete with:
- **Source code** (`.mwp` files)
- **Documentation** (exported ladder logic PDFs and screenshots)
- **Project-specific README.md** files for detailed explanations

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical PLC programming skills, industrial automation concepts, and professional documentation for academic and industry applications.
